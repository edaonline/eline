WITH Statement: Used to organize complex queries to be reused later

For this challenge you need to create a SELECT statement, this SELECT statement will use an 
IN to check whether a department has had a sale with a price over 90.00 dollars BUT the sql 
MUST use the WITH statement which will be used to select all columns from sales where the price 
is greater than 90.00, you must call this subquery special_sales

WITH special_sales AS (SELECT * FROM salesWHERE (price) > 90.00)
SELECT id,nameFROM departments WHERE id IN (SELECT department_id FROM special_sales) ;
